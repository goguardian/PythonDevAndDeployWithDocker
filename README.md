# Development and Deployment with Docker and Python
---

This repo is for the SoCal Python Meetup at GoGuardian, on Thursday, 3/28/2019.
In this repo are resources to build your own development environment and deploy a toy machine learning model using Docker!

## Presentation Slides:

* [Develop with Docker](devWithDocker/Slides.pdf)
* [Deploy with Docker](deployWithDocker/Slides.pdf)

## Getting Started:

1. [**Install Docker CE**](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. **Stop any processes** you have running on ports `8888` or `8081`
3. **(Optional)** Create a [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com) account and log in to Docker on your machine through the GUI or with `docker login`
4. Run the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/goguardian/PythonDevAndDeployWithDocker.git
$ cd PythonDevAndDeployWithDocker/devWithDocker
$ docker-compose build
```

You should now be building a docker image! If any of these steps fail, especially the `docker pull`, try again in a few minutes!
